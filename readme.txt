You need Python 2.7 to run this program.
This is the download page: http://www.python.org/getit/
If you have a Mac or Unix system, chances are you
already have Python. Check your version.

FAQ:

1. The player list doesn't update! How come?
It doesn't update automatically from your games.
You have to use the analyzer and select the names
that you want to analyze. They get added to the list.
Please, check that the name you give the analyzer
is exactly the SAME as the one form your hands file.

2. Is there double yakuman?
Yes, there is multiple yakuman.
For 1 yakuman, use 13 han.
For 2 yakuman, use 26 han.
And so on and so forth.

3. How about abortive draws? What if someone reached before
an abortive draw? (Tochuu Ryuukyoku)
Choosing the "5.Draw" option and setting everyone to tenpai
does the trick. The effect is the same as an abortive draw.
If someone reached, please, select the "riichi" option
accordingly.

4. The dealer made a chonbo and he rotated!
Yes. This is the usual procedure. If for whatever reason you
play with a different ruleset where you don't rotate your dealer
even if he is the one who commits a fault, just delete line number 98
from mahjong.pyw (be careful not to alter anything unrelated)

This program contains:

- analyzer.py
- hands.txt
- mahjong.pyw
- main.py
- players.txt
- readme ASAP.txt

This program is pretty much intuitive:

0) Unzip all the files to the same folder.
1) Run main.py, preferrably in a Python Interactive window.
2) Follow the instructions.
3) When you have an appropriate amount of games, run
analyzer.py, follow the instructions and check your
"seiseki.txt" file for detailed stats.

*If* you ever delete a txt file by accident (hands.txt, players.txt,
etc) and any of the tools stop working,
just make a new, empty txt file with the same name.

The more you use this tool for your games, the more it can
feed on stats and give you more information and data.

Thanks for downloading and using.

If you want to help me, here are two things you can do:

0) Help me build a GUI for this tool! It would seriously
help the appeal.
1) Get over 10 games done with your friends/group, and send
me your seiseki.txt file. I would love to gather data on
the different players from pretty much anywhere. Please,
include your location! (nicobsas@gmail.com)

Do note, PLEASE, don't use names composed of two or more words
separated by a space, or you will not be able to use the
analyzer. Also, all point profit/gain/loss stats generated by
the analyzer do not count deposits (this is a negligible amount).

If you find a bug, or there is a feature you would like to see
included, contact me at my email adress. In fact, please, contact
me regarding anything related to this tool. I would love to hear it.

Enjoy this program. I hope it makes your club activities or home games
a lot more fluid.
